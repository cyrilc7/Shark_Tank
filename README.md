## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the TV show Shark Tank US first aired in 2009. By analyzing various aspects of the pitches and deals that were made on this show, readers can prepare their own pitches, identify trends, get data-driven recommendations and overall prepare their entrepreneurship journey.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sharktank.csv" file presenting detailed information about all the pitches ever displayed on TV since season 1. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-us-dataset/data). I also added information for [this website](https://sharktanktales.com/shark-tank-pitches/all-shark-tank-products/)

## Process of Analysis

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
   * Data loading and inspection 
   * Cleaning columns
   * Changing data types
   * Seperating data in smaller tables for better clarity

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, we answered key questions with SQL. Some of the techniques used include:
   * Create, Update, Alter and Insert Tables
   * Joins and Unions
   * CTEs
   * Subqueries
   * Conditional and case statements

### Data Visualization

For Data Visualization, we used Tableau with the following techniques:
   * Diverse graphs
   * Calculated fields and parameters
   * Dynamic and interactive display of results

## Results

Results are published on a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cyril.crocheton/viz/SharkTankAnalysis_17076226949450/SharkTank) for better clarity and easy understanding.

## Limitations

This dataset needs better maintenance especially in the most recent seasons.
